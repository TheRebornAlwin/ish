# INFINITY SMART HOME SYSTEMS - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
**Simple, Fast-Track Guide for £100k+ Client Conversion**

---

## 🎯 WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR SITE

- ❌ No case studies or real project photos
- ❌ No "About Us" credibility
- ❌ Service pages all look identical (template problem)
- ❌ Vague copy: "elegant automation blah blah" that doesn't answer questions
- ❌ Scroll hijacking bugs (auto-scrolling frustrating users)
- ❌ No booking system
- ❌ Poor performance (slow loading)
- ❌ Not accessible (losing SEO + clients)
- ❌ Button transitions feel cheap

**Bottom line:** Looks like a template, not a £100k+ company.

6. BUG FIXES:
