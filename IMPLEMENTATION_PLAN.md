# INFINITY SMART HOME SYSTEMS - MVP IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
**Fast-Track Execution Guide for £100k+ Client Conversion**

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

- ❌ No booking/consultation system
- ❌ Service pages all look identical (template problem)
- ❌ Vague, fluffy copy ("elegant automation blah blah")
- ❌ Scroll hijacking bugs causing UX issues
- ❌ Poor Core Web Vitals performance
- ❌ No accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.2)
- ❌ Button transitions too abrupt
- ❌ Typography not premium enough
- ❌ Missing structured data/SEO optimization

## 2.2 CONTENT TRANSFORMATION (Kill the Fluff)

### Homepage Copy Audit & Rewrite
**Issue:** Vague, fluffy copy like "elegant automation" that doesn't answer client questions

**Implementation Tasks:**

```markdown
### Task 2.2.1: Audit and Rewrite Homepage
**Prompt for Claude:**
"Audit the current homepage (index.html) and rewrite ALL vague copy:

**Current issues to fix:**
- 'Elegant intelligent automation blah blah' → Replace with specific benefits
- Generic 'quality' statements → Replace with concrete features
- No mention of who this is for → Add target audience clarity
- Vague process descriptions → Add specific steps
- Features without context → Explain actual use cases

**Audit each section and rewrite:**

1. **Hero Section:**
   - Current: [analyze current copy]
   - Rewrite to: Immediately communicate WHO you serve and WHAT problem you solve
   - Example: 'Smart Home Design & Installation for New Builds and Luxury Retrofits in [Region]'

2. **Features Grid Section:**
   - Current: Likely vague benefits
   - Rewrite to: Specific, concrete capabilities
   - Remove: Any feature that doesn't answer 'so what?'
   - Add: Real-world scenarios

3. **Process Timeline:**
   - Current: [analyze current]
   - Rewrite step names to be crystal clear
   - Add: What client gets at each step
   - Make it: Client-focused (not company-focused)

4. **Service Cards:**
   - Current: Probably too short and vague
   - Rewrite to: Include WHO needs it, STARTING price, KEY outcome
   - Example: 'Home Theatre — Dedicated cinema rooms from £25k — 4K projection, Dolby Atmos, acoustic treatment'

5. **CTA Sections:**
   - Make specific: Not 'Get Started', but 'Book Free Consultation' or 'Get a Quote'
   - Add value prop: 'No-obligation consultation to discuss your project'

**Criteria for ALL copy:**
- ✅ Concrete and specific
- ✅ Answers 'so what?' for busy 48-year-old
- ✅ Mentions technology/brands where relevant
- ✅ Includes outcomes or examples
- ❌ No marketing fluff
- ❌ No 'luxury' or 'elegant' without backing it up
- ❌ No features without explaining benefit

**User provides:**
- Service area (cities/regions you serve)
- Target customer profile
- Key differentiators (facts)

**Claude writes:**
- All new headline copy
- All body copy
- All CTAs
- All section descriptions

**Tone:** Direct, professional, confident. Think Crestron/Control4 dealer, not lifestyle magazine."
```

### Service Page Copy Transformation
**Issue:** Service pages all have the same generic copy

**Implementation Tasks:**

```markdown
### Task 2.2.2: Rewrite All Service Pages
**Prompt for Claude:**
"Rewrite ALL 8 service pages with unique, specific copy for each:

**User will provide for each service:**
- Who typically needs this
- Technology/brands used
- Starting price range (optional)
- One real example
- Unique approach/process

**Claude will write:**
- Unique headline (not 'Quality [Service]')
- Who this is for section
- What's included section (itemized)
- How we're different section
- Technology we use section
- Real example/mini case study
- FAQ (3-5 questions specific to that service)
- Pricing guidance (if user provides range)

**Services to rewrite:**
1. /smart-home-design.html
2. /home-theatre.html
3. /wifi-networking.html
4. /multi-room-audio.html
5. /video-distribution.html
6. /smart-shading.html
7. /security-cctv.html
8. /electrical-installation.html

**Example transformation:**

Current (vague):
'Quality entertainment systems for your home'

New (specific):
'Dedicated Home Cinema Installation
Build a private screening room that rivals commercial cinemas. From equipment selection to acoustic treatment and calibration, we handle every detail.

Who this is for:
- New build homeowners with dedicated media room
- Retrofit projects (basements, spare bedrooms)
- Luxury properties requiring high-end AV

What's included:
- 4K laser projector or 85"+ display
- Dolby Atmos surround sound (7.1.4 or higher)
- Acoustic panels and bass traps
- Motorized screen and blackout shading
- Control4/Crestron integration
- Professional calibration

Technology we use:
Sony/JVC projectors, Triad speakers, Stewart Filmscreen, Control4

Example project:
5-bedroom property in Clifton — 16-seat cinema with Dolby Atmos, JVC 4K projector, acoustic treatment throughout. Budget: £85k

Starting from: £25,000 (basic setup) to £150,000+ (full custom cinema)'"
```

### Case Study Page Copy
**Implementation Tasks:**

```markdown
### Task 2.2.3: Write Case Study Pages
**Prompt for Claude:**
"Transform raw project facts into compelling case studies:

**User provides (from manual phase):**
- Project basic info (location, type, budget, timeline)
- Client's problem (raw facts)
- What was installed (technical specs)
- Client testimonial quote
- Outcomes (measurable results)
- 4-8 project photos

**Claude writes:**
1. Engaging project title
2. 'The Challenge' section (200-300 words storytelling)
3. 'Our Solution' section (300-400 words, technical but readable)
4. Photo captions that explain what's shown
5. 'The Result' section with client testimonial integration
6. Technical details section (for nerds)
7. SEO-optimized meta descriptions
8. Schema markup for Article type

**Style:**
- Start with the problem/pain point
- Explain thinking behind decisions
- Use specific numbers (not 'many' - use '47 smart devices')
- Show expertise through details
- End with measurable outcome

**Example opening:**
'When the owners of this 6-bedroom new build in Cardiff approached us, they had a problem: their architect had designed a dedicated cinema room, but no one had thought about the acoustic challenges of a 25-foot vaulted ceiling. The space looked stunning, but without treatment, it would sound terrible.

We started with acoustic modeling...'"
```

.btn-gold {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, var(--gold-400) 0%, var(--gold-300) 100%);
  color: var(--charcoal);
  transition: all 400ms cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1); /* Bouncy */
  box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(203, 175, 130, 0.2);
}

.btn-gold:hover {

## 2.5 UX FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS

### Remove Scroll Hijacking
**Issue:** Scroll behavior is causing "unexpected scrolling" and "auto-switching"

**Implementation Tasks:**

```markdown
### Task 2.5.1: Fix Process Timeline Scroll Bug
**Prompt for Claude:**
"Remove scroll hijacking from process timeline section:

Current problems (lines 1477-1593 in index.html):
- Locks scroll when section visible
- Forces users through all 7 steps
- Prevents natural browsing
- Causes frustration

New behavior:
1. Remove IntersectionObserver lock (line 1499-1526)
2. Remove wheel event preventDefault (line 1528-1558)
3. Remove touch event hijacking (line 1560-1593)
4. Keep click handlers for manual step navigation
5. Add subtle scroll-based progress (optional):
   - As user scrolls through section naturally
   - Progress indicator shows which step is in viewport
   - No forced stops or locks

Alternative approach:
- Make it a horizontal scroll section (swipe through steps)
- OR make it click-only (remove scroll interaction entirely)
- OR add 'Skip to next section' button if user wants out

Ensure:
- Users can scroll freely at all times
- No unexpected jumps
- Smooth, natural browsing experience"

### Task 2.5.2: Fix Mode Switcher Auto-Advance
