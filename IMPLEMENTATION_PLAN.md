CASE STUDY FACTS (CREATE 3 COMPELLING CASE STUDIES WITH STORYTELLING)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CASE STUDY #1: Cardiff Bay Penthouse Cinema**
Location: Cardiff Bay, South Wales
Property type: 3-bed luxury penthouse
Budget: £85,000
Timeline: 8 weeks design + 4 weeks install
Services: Dedicated cinema room, whole-home lighting, multi-room audio

THE PROBLEM:
- Client (property developer) wanted dedicated cinema room but architect designed 25-foot vaulted ceiling
- Room looked stunning but would have terrible acoustics without treatment
- Wanted to entertain clients/family with cinema-grade experience
- Needed it integrated with whole-home system (not separate remote)

WHAT WE INSTALLED:
- Control system: Control4 EA-5 controller
- Video: JVC NX7 4K laser projector, 150" Stewart Filmscreen motorized screen
- Audio: Dolby Atmos 7.2.4 system with Triad in-wall/ceiling speakers, 4 subwoofers
- Lighting: Lutron RA3 with cinema scenes (dim to 10% over 5 seconds when movie starts)
- Acoustic treatment: 24 acoustic panels on ceiling/walls, bass traps in corners
- Seating: 6 motorized recliners with USB charging
- Network: Dedicated VLAN for AV equipment, 10Gb switch for 4K streaming

RESULTS:
Client quote: "When we show guests the cinema, they can't believe it's in a residential building. The sound is better than our local Odeon, and everything works from one remote. Tim's team even trained my wife how to use it - she's not technical but now she fires up Netflix without me." - David Chen, Property Developer
Measurable outcome: Controls entire 3-bed penthouse (47 smart devices) from Control4 app - lighting, cinema, music, blinds, security all integrated
Now hosts monthly movie nights for business clients - cinema has become his main entertainment/networking space

PHOTOS NEEDED:
- Before: Empty room with vaulted ceiling
- During: Acoustic panels being installed
- After: Completed cinema with seating (lights on)
- After: Cinema in use (movie playing, lights dimmed)
- Equipment rack in closet (clean wiring)
- Control4 interface showing cinema scene

**CASE STUDY #2: Bristol New Build - Whole Home Automation**
Location: Clifton, Bristol
Property type: 5-bed detached new build
Budget: £120,000
Timeline: 12 weeks (pre-wire during build, 3 weeks final install/programming)
Services: Whole-home automation, cinema, multi-room audio, networking, lighting, security

THE PROBLEM:
- Architect-designed new build but no smart home plan
- Builder asking "where do you want network points?" - client had no idea
- Wanted invisible tech (no visible cables, keypads, or ugly hardware)
- Needed coordination between electrician, plasterer, AV installer
- Timeline pressure - had to hit practical completion date

WHAT WE INSTALLED:
- Control: Control4 EA-5 main controller + 3x satellite controllers
- Lighting: Lutron RA3 throughout (40 zones), 12 architectural scenes (morning, evening, entertaining, away, cinema, etc.)
- Audio: 12-zone distributed audio (Triad in-ceiling speakers every room), outdoor patio system
- Cinema: Dedicated media room with 85" Sony TV, 7.1 surround, acoustic treatment
- Video distribution: 4K to 6 TVs (centralized Sky/Apple TV in equipment closet)
- Network: Ubiquiti UniFi - 8 access points, wired backhaul, separate VLANs for IoT/guests
- Security: 10x 4K AI cameras, Yale smart locks front/back, integrated alarm
- Shading: 14 motorized blinds (automated sun tracking)

RESULTS:
Client quote: "The coordination was incredible. Infinity provided CAD drawings to our builder, did 3 site visits during first fix, tested every cable before plastering. When we moved in, everything just worked. One app controls the entire house - even my kids can set movie mode." - James Sullivan, Business Owner
Measurable outcome: House responds to routines - 'Good Morning' scene opens blinds, starts coffee machine, plays news in kitchen. 'Leaving' locks doors, arms alarm, sets heating to eco mode. Reduced energy costs by 18% in first year (automated heating/lighting/shading)
Now showing house to friends as reference for their builds - has referred 2 clients to Infinity

PHOTOS NEEDED:
- Pre-wire walkthrough (cables labeled, equipment closet roughed in)
- Equipment rack (clean professional wiring)
- Living room (hidden in-ceiling speakers, no visible tech)
- Cinema room (separate from main living)
- Lutron lighting scene (evening mode)
- Control4 app showing whole-home control

**CASE STUDY #3: Newport Retrofit - Rescuing Failed Smart Home**
Location: Newport, South Wales
Property type: 4-bed detached (10 years old)
Budget: £35,000
Timeline: 6 weeks
Services: System replacement, networking upgrade, lighting retrofit

THE PROBLEM:
- Previous installer (now defunct) left client with unreliable system
- Lights randomly turned on at 3am, audio cutting out, app crashing constantly
- No support, no documentation, couldn't get anyone to fix it
- Considered ripping it all out and going back to regular switches
- Frustrated and embarrassed - had spent £40k originally and couldn't show anyone

WHAT WE INSTALLED:
- Replaced failing proprietary system with Control4 EA-3
- Lighting: Kept existing Lutron wiring, replaced old processors with RA3, reprogrammed all scenes
- Network: Replaced consumer mesh WiFi with Ubiquiti UniFi (6 APs, managed switch) - was causing dropouts
- Audio: Salvaged existing Sonos but properly integrated into Control4
- Diagnostics: Found 12 network issues, 8 wiring faults, 3 failed modules from original install

RESULTS:
Client quote: "For 3 years we lived with a 'smart home' that made us feel stupid. Lights doing their own thing, nothing reliable. Infinity diagnosed everything in one day, gave us a fixed-price quote to fix it properly, and now it actually works. We've gone from hating our smart home to using it every single day. Tim's support has been incredible - he responds within hours even for small questions." - Richard & Sarah Thompson, Homeowners
Measurable outcome: System uptime went from ~60% (frequent failures) to 99.9% reliable. Client now confident enough to show friends - has become advocate for smart homes (was previously warning people against them)
Support package includes quarterly system checks - preventive maintenance vs reactive firefighting

PHOTOS NEEDED:
- Before: Messy wiring from previous installer
- During: New equipment rack being built
- After: Clean professional rack with labeling
- After: Family using system reliably (happy client photo)
- Control4 app showing simplified interface

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHOTOS TO REQUEST FROM CLIENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Tell client: "We need 15-20 real project photos organized by project (not by service type). For each of the 3 case studies above, provide 4-6 photos showing:
- Before shots (if available) showing space before install
- During install (equipment racks, wiring, in-progress work showing quality)
- Completed rooms (cinema, living spaces, lighting scenes)
- Equipment closets (clean professional wiring - this builds trust)
- Close-ups of invisible tech (in-ceiling speakers, hidden touch panels)
- Clients using the system (optional but powerful for testimonials)"

If client doesn't have photos: "Schedule site visits to photograph 2-3 completed projects this week. Prioritize cinema rooms and equipment racks - these have highest visual impact."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
